# Development map: how the recording and speaker paths connect

This is an orientation map for contributors and coding agents, not a substitute
for reading the owning code. The map describes this branch's implementation;
release availability and qualification are separate facts documented below.

## 1. Keep these three responsibilities separate

| Responsibility | Owner | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transcription | Parakeet, Whisper, or configured provider | Produces words and transcript timing. |
| Diarization | Selected Pyannote/WeSpeaker or Nemotron engine | Assigns meeting-local speaker labels to audio/transcript turns. |
| Capture provenance | Independent microphone/system tracks | Establishes the local `You` label; it is not inferred from speaker channel 0. |

Nemotron is diarization, not voice isolation. Its overlapping activity predictions
do not produce separate audio tracks for each remote voice. Names, voiceprints,
and a model's anonymous speaker channels are also different concepts.

## 2. Recording data flow

```text
recording_commands.rs: start command
  -> initialize selected live diarizer before capture (blocking work off Tokio)
  -> recording_manager.rs: devices + recording state + capture/pipeline
     -> pipeline.rs: align microphone and system audio into windows
        -> separate VAD processors for microphone and system
           -> vad.rs: resample to 16 kHz
              -> continuous observer BEFORE silence removal
                 -> system only: live_nemotron::feed(recording_sample, audio)
              -> VAD speech turns -> transcription queue
                 (Labs near-live: quiet-frame split at about 2 s even without silence)
        -> persist mic/system source tracks and mixed playback audio
     -> transcription/worker.rs: transcribe each source's speech turn
        -> microphone: You
        -> Pyannote selected: online embedding/centroid speaker matching
        -> Nemotron selected: query streaming timeline by turn start + duration
        -> transcript-update event
           -> frontend TranscriptContext + live transcript view
              (Labs near-live: display joins interleaved chunks per speaker)
           -> native recording transcript accumulator/save path
```

### Source files to read together

Paths below are relative to `frontend/src-tauri/src/` unless marked frontend.

| File | Owns / why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `audio/recording_commands.rs` | Start/stop orchestration, selected-engine initialization, task lifetime, and transcript-update saving. Both recording start entry points need consistent behavior. |
| `audio/recording_manager.rs` | Starts capture and the audio pipeline, coordinates source state and recording storage. |
| `audio/pipeline.rs` | Alignment, independent source VAD, queueing completed turns, source/mixed track persistence, final audio drain. |
| `audio/vad.rs` | Resampling and VAD clocks. `process_audio_observed` supplies continuous 16 kHz audio before speech segmentation. |
| `audio/near_live.rs` | Durable Labs flag and speech cap. The pipeline snapshots it at recording start. See [NEAR_LIVE_CAPTIONS.md](NEAR_LIVE_CAPTIONS.md). |
| `audio/transcription/worker.rs` | ASR execution and the final speaker/source string carried by transcript updates. |
| `diarization/online.rs` | Selects the live engine at recording start; retains the existing Pyannote/WeSpeaker online clustering implementation. |
| `diarization/live_nemotron.rs` | Dedicated streaming inference thread, bounded queue, timestamped history, overlap lookup, error notification, and input-close/stop distinction. |
| `diarization/nemotron.rs` | Validates the pinned model and adapts the attributed Sortformer API to Meetily. Live configuration must not change offline defaults. |
| `diarization/sortformer/` | Attributed model implementation, including speaker cache, feed/flush, streaming profiles, and ORT session construction. Preserve license/attribution. |
| `audio/recording_saver.rs`, `audio/incremental_saver.rs` | Persistent transcript/source hints and recording tracks. A displayed rename alone does not update every save path. |
| `frontend/src/contexts/TranscriptContext.tsx` | Frontend transcript events, ordering/buffering, local recovery, and live state. |
| `frontend/src/components/VirtualizedTranscriptView.tsx` | Labs near-live display joins each speaker's short chunks even when the other source has an intervening turn; saved chunks are unchanged. |

### Time and identity invariants

- Capture/pipeline input is currently configured at 48 kHz. The streaming observer
  receives **16 kHz mono**, using the exact same resampled audio as VAD.
- Observer start positions and Sortformer segment boundaries use **16 kHz sample
  indices**. Transcript chunks carry recording-relative **seconds**. VAD speech
  boundaries expose **milliseconds**. Convert explicitly at boundaries.
- The observer position includes the VAD frame buffer, not just processed frames.
  Ignoring that buffer causes timestamp drift between diarization and transcripts.
- Preserve silence and timeline gaps. Concatenating VAD speech turns without
  their gaps is not a continuous recording and corrupts streaming timing.
- Mic and system audio must not be mixed before source attribution. Microphone
  audio retains `You`; remote model channels remain `Speaker N`.
- Speaker channels are meeting-local. The live model/cache is recreated for each
  recording. Changing settings during a call affects the next live session.
- One transcript turn currently gets one greatest-overlap label. Do not split
  text or fabricate word timestamps to represent within-turn speaker changes.

### Worker and shutdown ownership

The capture path only attempts a nonblocking send. A dedicated thread owns the
Nemotron model; ASR workers read its shared timeline rather than running model
inference on the capture/Tokio thread. The queue holds 600 50 ms windows. Full or
disconnected input reports an error and disables that session's labeling.

`finish()` closes streaming input after the pipeline has submitted its remaining
audio. The worker drains, flushes its final lookahead, and publishes a completion
watermark. **Do not destroy the timeline at this point**: final transcription
turns still need it. `stop()` releases the session after transcription processing
has been drained by recording-stop orchestration. Startup failures also clean up
the live session.

The low-latency profile buffers 1.04 s of audio, emits 0.72 s strides, and uses
0.32 s lookahead. These model parameters are not an end-to-end UI latency claim:
VAD boundaries, ASR time, and queue load also contribute. Timeline lookup waits
at most 1.5 s; history is limited to ten minutes. Missing/failed results retain
source labels rather than guessing a speaker or switching engines.

## 3. Post-call processing and model selection

`diarization/mod.rs` owns persisted engine settings and offline command dispatch.
Nemotron is Auto-detect only; manual counts belong to Pyannote. Rerunning speaker
identification must preserve transcript text, row identity, and timestamps.
Read [PR34_NEMOTRON.md](PR34_NEMOTRON.md) before changing that contract.

Frontend post-call sequencing lives in
`frontend/src/components/MeetingDetails/PostCallProcessingDialog.tsx` and related
speaker/retranscription dialogs. `useDiarizationEngine.ts` refreshes selected-engine
state for dialogs, including native activation events and stale-response guards.

Live ASR and post-call ASR defaults are independent. Optional Whisper activation
saves the **post-call** default; it must not replace the live Parakeet selection.

## 4. Optional download ownership and UI synchronization

`frontend/src/contexts/OptionalModelDownloadsContext.tsx` owns optional jobs above
onboarding and Settings so normal navigation does not cancel them. This is not an
OS background service. An app exit and a WebView reload are different lifetimes.

For Nemotron, `download_diarization_models` in `diarization/mod.rs` performs the
verified download **and persists engine activation in native code**. On success
it emits `diarization-engine-changed`. This prevents page reloads from discarding
a required preference save in an abandoned JS completion callback.

The native event updates the optional-download card, Diarization Settings, and
open speaker dialogs. The frontend `optional-model-preferences-changed` DOM event
also refreshes preference views for frontend-triggered changes. These events are
different transports; neither is itself the persisted source of truth.

Read [NEMOTRON_NATIVE_ACTIVATION.md](NEMOTRON_NATIVE_ACTIVATION.md) for the regression
and installed-app test. Read [V0219_BACKGROUND_SETUP.md](V0219_BACKGROUND_SETUP.md)
and [V0220_OPTIONAL_ACTIVATION.md](V0220_OPTIONAL_ACTIVATION.md) as historical notes;
later fixes supersede earlier behavior. Whisper still has a frontend completion/
activation path: do not infer that Nemotron's native-lifetime fix covers it too.

## 5. Acceleration and packaging are separate from ASR selection

Windows Nemotron uses the pinned shared ONNX Runtime/DirectML integration, with
CPU-session recreation when provider initialization fails. It does not inherit
Whisper's CUDA/Vulkan/CPU backend selection. Read `onnx_runtime.rs`,
`frontend/src-tauri/build/onnxruntime.rs`, and the Sortformer session builder before
changing runtime loading or execution-provider settings.

Labs Parakeet GPU acceleration is a separate native preference in
`parakeet_engine/labs.rs`. It reloads the selected Parakeet model and places the
encoder session on DirectML device 0; the decoder and preprocessor remain on
CPU. Provider initialization errors are reported to Settings and the prior
preference/model is restored. This does not change Nemotron or Whisper's
backend. `get_local_stack_status` reports the native preference to the Local
stack UI; its previous Parakeet CPU pill was fixed text. An ignored test with
the installed v3 INT8 model and synthetic silence confirms encoder nodes run
on both DirectML and CPU; real speech performance remains unqualified.

The universal Windows build script is
`frontend/scripts/build-universal-windows.ps1`. It packages CPU/Vulkan/CUDA app
variants; the runtime payload must match the one validated in tests. Validate with
`node frontend/scripts/verify-windows-release.mjs`.

## 6. Tests, qualification, and historical notes

### Home meeting library

`frontend/src/app/home/page.tsx` renders the date-sorted meeting library and is
the Tauri startup route (`/home`). The recording-ready screen remains `/`; the
sidebar's New Recording action opens it. `SidebarProvider` owns the shared meeting
list and refresh/error state. `api_get_meetings` in `api/api.rs` batches saved
summaries and transcript labels, returning raw summary data, a plain-text preview,
and distinct custom speaker names in first-spoken order alongside date/duration.
Generated/source labels are excluded using `is_person_name`; these names are only
meeting display snapshots, not inferred cross-meeting identities. Home and meeting
details share the legacy/Markdown/BlockNote topic classifier in
`frontend/src/lib/summary-buckets.ts`. Home groups full-width meeting cards by
local date, connects each day's cards with a timeline, and filters title, named
participants, summary, and topics with the search field. Cards show a short
summary paragraph and at most three short Key Topics labels. Topic bullets with
label/explanation markup display only the label; the full summary is retained.
Missing summaries remain an explicit empty state. Cards link to the existing meeting detail route; Home
refreshes its list on entry after a summary is saved. `StartupTranscriptRecovery`
now mounts in the shared layout so IndexedDB recovery checks still run when Home
opens first. Tray/notification start events from Home route to `/` with the
auto-start flag for the recording hook. Topic extraction remains heuristic and
depends on a recognizable Key Topics heading or legacy section. Verification
covers frontend/native builds and the Windows installer payload; a local installer
is not a published release.

### Speaker colors in transcripts

`speakerUtils.ts` supplies the shared dot/text palette for the live and post-call
virtualized transcript and the detected-speakers sidebar. The Tailwind scan must
include `src/utils`, where the palette class names are declared, or named speakers
can render without a dot or text color in production. Both transcript views
assign palette slots by first-spoken meeting order. A rename changes the display
label in place and retains its slot; `You` stays blue. The palette has eight
remote slots, so meetings with more than eight remote speakers reuse colors.
The focused `tests/lib/speaker-colors.test.mjs` checks slot continuity on rename;
the Next production CSS output must also contain every dot palette class.

Labs roadmap features 1, 3, 7, 8, and 12 are mapped in
[LABS_MACWHISPER_FEATURES.md](LABS_MACWHISPER_FEATURES.md). Read it before
changing meeting detection, recorded audio seeking, named voice enrollment,
Whisper silence thresholds, or the clean transcript display. The Labs settings
page stores frontend preferences; the Whisper and voice-profile switches also
persist in native app data so they survive a WebView reload. Named profiles use
WeSpeaker embeddings in Pyannote live sessions and as a separate identity
matcher for Nemotron live and both post-call paths. Nemotron remains the selected
diarizer; its channel numbers never establish persistent identity.

From `frontend/`, run mock-heavy groups separately:

```text
pnpm dlx bun@1.3.10 test tests/optional-downloads/background.test.tsx
pnpm dlx bun@1.3.10 test tests/diarization/engine-selection.test.tsx
pnpm dlx bun@1.3.10 test tests/hooks
pnpm run build
```

Native tests containing `live_nemotron` cover timeline attribution, retained tail,
history bounds, and the resampled observer clock. With the project's native build
prerequisites configured, use `cargo test -p meetily --lib live_nemotron` and the
appropriate platform feature flags. Windows qualification uses release binaries
and the packaged shared runtime; local `.build-tools/` scripts are environment-
specific conveniences, not substitutes for documenting prerequisites/results.

Ignored real-model tests require `MEETILY_NEMOTRON_MODEL` and
`MEETILY_NEMOTRON_WAV` (16 kHz WAV). The identity test optionally reads
`MEETILY_NEMOTRON_EXPECTED`, a JSON array of `{voice, start, end}` in seconds.
Run with `--ignored --nocapture --test-threads=1`; a normal unit-test pass does
not mean these model tests ran. Use nonprivate fixtures and report synthetic
throughput separately from real-call accuracy and concurrent-ASR performance.

Do not run Next builds concurrently with native commands embedding `frontend/out`
or with standalone TypeScript checking. When using pnpm in this environment,
`PNPM_CONFIG_ENABLE_GLOBAL_VIRTUAL_STORE=false` avoids the known store-layout issue.

The public release documented in README is distinct from a local candidate.
Development labels 0.2.18–0.2.20 in historical notes were consolidated into the
0.2.17 candidate after checking GitHub's published 0.2.16. Re-check the actual
release state before future version work; do not treat this historical statement
as a permanently current release number.
